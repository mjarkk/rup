# `rup` A reliable udp server & client library
*the name is based on the [rudp from plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_User_Datagram_Protocol) but witout the p*

## But why?
Fist of all i just made this to learn a lot.  
But secondly i'm planing to use this in a bigger project that needs a libary/protocol like this to succeed.  

## Feather goals
- Fast
- Reliable
- Support for UDP hole punching

### Where are the docs
At the moment the project is still in a early stage of development and there for lots of changers.  
Due to that i'm not providing any documentation for now.  

## Alternatives
- **[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/)**
- **[HTTP/3 (quic)](https://quicwg.org/base-drafts/draft-ietf-quic-http.html)**
